## Running

* Compile all source files with ````mdtool build MadBeez.csproj````
* The output is in ````bin/debug````

## Further Work

* The code has been commented simplistically but could be extended further
* A few TODOs as graphical improvements have been commented in the code, these include:
	* Better loading of image icons
	* More efficient setup of GUI
* A gitignore for when this does not need to be demoed
